Known BUGS

   o	the hessian function in numDeriv does not accept method="simple".  Only 
	"Richardson" is implemented there. 
 
   o	When method="Richardson", it does not work when r=1, because of 
	subscripting issues.  Should fix this such that it does 
	a central difference approximation, without any extrapolation. 
 

Changes in numDeriv version 2010.11-1

   o	Added warning in the documentation regarding trying to pass arguments
   	in ... with the same names as numDeriv function arguments.

 

Changes in numDeriv version 2010.2-1

   o	Added more graceful failure in the case of NA returned by a function
	(thanks to Adam Kramer).

   o	Standardized NEWS format for new function news().


Changes in numDeriv version 2009.2-1

   o	argument zero.tol was added to grad, jacobian and genD, and is used to 
	test if parameters are zero in order to determine if eps should be used
	in place of d. Previous tests using == did not work for very small values.

   o	defaults argument d to grad was 0.0001, but specification made it 
   	appear to be 0.1. Specification was changed to make default clear.

   o	unnecessary hessian.default argument setting was removed (they are 
	just passed to genD which duplicated the setting).

   o	Some documentation links to [stats]numericDeriv mistakenly called 
	numericalDeriv were fixed.  
  

Changes in numDeriv version 2006.4-1

   o	First released version.
